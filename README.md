# nvx-app-hornet-tick-to-trade
A Hornet Based EMS App For Low Latency Trading

###  SPEED
**Time to First Slice**: How long from the time a trader makes trading decision to the time when the market reflects that decision.

**Tick to Trade**: “How fast can your EMS respond to advertised price?”

### EASE
“How agile are you at being able to change your business logic?”

**See how an application on top of the Hornet and The X Platform a 100% Pure Jave application platform with no infrastructure code needed can serve up trades in the 10s of microsends.**
